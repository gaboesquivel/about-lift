# The Pura Vida Decentralized Autonomous Community

A DAC for people who share the Pura Vida values.

> If you have been to Costa Rica, a term you should be familiar with is “Pura Vida.” Simply translated, it means “simple life” or “pure life”, but in Costa Rica, it is more than just a saying, its a lifestyle. 

## Purpose

The Pura Vida DAC builds open source software and operates services to protect the commons and keep them thriving for generations to come.

## Summary

The Pura Vida community focuses on building tools, protocols, services and educational resources to facilitate the creation and governance of decentralized communities with a focus on social impact and conservation.

## Focus Areas

- DAC tools and Education.
- Decentralized Governance.
- Decentralized Finance.
- Sustainability and Conservation.

## Members

The Pura Vida DAC is an open community that embraces all members equally.    
Individuals, companies and organizations from of all nations can be part of it.

## Pura Vida DAC Token

We partnership with [BeSpiral](https://bespiral.com) to co-design governance mechanisms and token models. 

## The Pura Vida Treasury

The Pura Vida Treasury will be managed by the elected custodians.

## Deployment Plan

The first phase we will be focused on building up the community, open source tools, education and awareness. We will create partnerships and educational resources. We will collective design and implement the DAC Token, smart contracts and the systems required to run the DAC. We will receive sponsorships as well keep track of all of the members contributions so that they can be appropiately rewarded with Pura Vida DAC tokens when we launch on chain.

## The Hummingbird

We chose the this bird as our logo because of its symbolism:

The hummingbird symbolizes many different concepts, because of its speed, the hummingbird is known as a messenger, and guardian of time. ... The hummingbird passes the life drinking the nectar of the flowers, which means that we must savor every moment, and appreciate the things we love.

The Aztecs or Mexica, recognized the hummingbirds as courageous and brave fighters. He was admired because, despite his size, he showed great strength and power when flying. Its beauty, color and precision. It should be noted that the Mexicas thought that this time he never died, and was the symbol of Huitzilopochtli *, the god of war, will and determination.

## What is a DAC?

A Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC), sometimes referred to as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), is a community or organization that operates based on a set of rules agreed on by its community of token holders; these rules are coded into smart contracts and operate automatically, or autonomously. Each DAC determines its own set of rules to follow. Pura Vida DAc utilizes smart contracts in EOSIO blockchains.

## Why EOSIO Blockchains?

EOSIO is third generation blockchain software that allow us to build scalable and secure applications with a friendly UX. Its flexible permission system is what allows this type DAC to built on top of it.
