# The Pura Vida Decentralized Autonomous Community

A DAC for people who share the Pura Vida values.

> If you have been to Costa Rica, a term you should be familiar with is “Pura Vida.” Simply translated, it means “simple life” or “pure life”, but in Costa Rica, it is more than just a saying, its a lifestyle. The "Pura Vida" symbolizes for Costa Ricans the simplicity of good living, well-being, joy, happiness and optimism, associated with the art of appreciating beauty in the simple and natural.

## Purpose

The Pura Vida DAC focuses on building open source software and dApps that empower people and help create abundance on earth.

## Members

The Pura Vida DAC is an open community that embraces all members equally.    
Individuals, companies and organizations from of all nations can be part of it.

## Pura Vida DAC Token

We partnership with [BeSpiral](https://bespiral.com) to co-design governance mechanisms and token models. 

## The Pura Vida Treasury

The Pura Vida Treasury will be managed by the elected custodians.

## The Hummingbird

We chose the this bird as our logo because of its symbolism:

The hummingbird symbolizes many different concepts, because of its speed, the hummingbird is known as a messenger, and guardian of time. The hummingbird passes the life drinking the nectar of the flowers, which means that we must savor every moment, and appreciate the things we love.

## What is a DAC?

A Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC), sometimes referred to as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), is a community or organization that operates based on a set of rules agreed on by its community of token holders; these rules are coded into smart contracts and operate automatically, or autonomously. Each DAC determines its own set of rules to follow. Pura Vida DAc utilizes smart contracts in EOSIO blockchains.

## Why EOSIO Blockchains?

EOSIO is third generation blockchain software that allow us to build scalable and secure applications with a friendly UX. Its flexible permission system is what allows this type DAC to built on top of it.
