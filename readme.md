# LIFT: A Community for Knowledge Sharing

_LIFT is an experimental community project, we are currently validating the following ideas._

LIFT token powers an ecosystem with courses and a freelance marketplace with an initial focus on latam.  

You can earn LIFT tokens as you learn once you pass the proofs of knowledge.

Teachers get LIFT as people watch the courses. 

Companies and people that want access to the dev market need tokens. In addition to courses there will be meetups, and organizers and active member get lifted too, and it's better than meetup.

## LIFT DAC

We suggest watching [The Power and Potential of DAO/Cs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf5gfjMfiHA) and [DAOs: The Way Towards Enlightened Global Governance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1K4M6iCSyE) as an introduction if you are not familiar with this new type of organization.

The LIFT DAC is an open community that embraces all members equally.    
Individuals, companies and organizations from of all nations can be part of it.

## Deployment Plan

The first phase we will be focused on building up the community, open source tools, education and awareness. We will collectively design and implement the DAC Token, smart contracts and the systems required to run the DAC. 

## The Hummingbird

We chose the this bird as our logo because of its symbolism:

The hummingbird symbolizes many different concepts, because of its speed, the hummingbird is known as a messenger, and guardian of time. The hummingbird passes the life drinking the nectar of the flowers, which means that we must savor every moment, and appreciate the things we love.

## Constitution

Coming soon.

## What is a DAC?

A Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC), sometimes referred to as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), is a community or organization that operates based on a set of rules agreed on by its community of token holders; these rules are coded into smart contracts and operate automatically, or autonomously. Each DAC determines its own set of rules to follow. Pura Vida DAc utilizes smart contracts in EOSIO blockchains.

## Why EOSIO Blockchains?

EOSIO is third generation blockchain software that allow us to build scalable and secure applications with a friendly UX. Its flexible permission system is what allows this type DAC to built on top of it. 

## Philosophy

A DAC for people who share the Pura Vida values.

> If you have been to Costa Rica, a term you should be familiar with is “Pura Vida.” Simply translated, it means “simple life” or “pure life”, but in Costa Rica, it is more than just a saying, its a lifestyle. The "Pura Vida" symbolizes for Costa Ricans the simplicity of good living, well-being, joy, happiness and optimism, associated with the art of appreciating beauty in the simple and natural.
