## The Hummingbird

We chose the this bird as our logo because of its symbolism:

The hummingbird symbolizes many different concepts, because of its speed, the hummingbird is known as a messenger, and guardian of time. The hummingbird passes the life drinking the nectar of the flowers, which means that we must savor every moment, and appreciate the things we love.

## Constitution

Coming soon.

## Philosophy

A DAC for people who share the Pura Vida values.

> If you have been to Costa Rica, a term you should be familiar with is “Pura Vida.” Simply translated, it means “simple life” or “pure life”, but in Costa Rica, it is more than just a saying, its a lifestyle. The "Pura Vida" symbolizes for Costa Ricans the simplicity of good living, well-being, joy, happiness and optimism, associated with the art of appreciating beauty in the simple and natural.

## What is a DAC?

A Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC), sometimes referred to as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), is a community or organization that operates based on a set of rules agreed on by its community of token holders; these rules are coded into smart contracts and operate automatically, or autonomously. Each DAC determines its own set of rules to follow. Pura Vida DAc utilizes smart contracts in EOSIO blockchains.

## Why EOSIO Blockchains?
